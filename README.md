# C# Labs 🖥️

Beginner-friendly C# practice projects.  
I’m using this repo to **learn and build core programming skills** while actively committing progress.

## 📌 What’s inside
- 🔹 **Variables & Conversions** – parsing input, type conversion, string/number basics  
- 🔹 **Branching** – `if/else`, `switch`, comparison & boolean operators  
- 🔹 **Lists & Loops** – collections, iteration, basic algorithms  
- 🔹 **Functions** – parameters, return values, input validation  
- 🔹 **Classes & Objects** – simple models (`Person`, `Rectangle`), member functions  
- 🔹 **Stretch ideas** – new exercises I’ll add as I learn

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice writing **clean C# code** with small, testable exercises  
- Build muscle memory for **loops, branching, functions, and OOP**  
- Learn **Git + GitHub workflow** (commit, push, history, branching)  
- Make steady public progress to track my growth
